#You Are My Life" Lyrics:-

O Allah!
You're the light that shines above
You're the reason I never give up
You're The One I try for, live my life for
Give up all I have
You're the melody, You're the key
All the inspiration I need
And when times get tough
I know You'll stand by me
 
You are the love I need
The One who is guiding me
And You know my destiny
For You are The Light
 
CHORUS:
And You are my life
Oh oh oh 
 
O Allah!
Your words light up my heart
This connection I've felt from the start
Iâ€™ll never lose sight of my dreams
Without You where would I be?
And although I feel like I'm 
A million miles away from home
I can lose all that I have and when I feel the pain
I know that I can count on You 

You are the love I need
The One who is guiding me
And You know my destiny
For You are The Light
